    <p>Cloud Security Watch is a tool aimed at highlighting common configurations in AWS which are not secure.</p>
    <p>Examples of these things are security groups with critical ports open to the outside world or S3 buckets
    with read/write access open to anyone.</p>
    <p>The aims of Cloud Security Watch are:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list">
      <li>To provide actionable and unambiguous warnings</li>
      <li>To provide clear remediation advice and instructions</li>
      <li>To remove false positives and allow for recording known exceptions</li>
    </ul>
